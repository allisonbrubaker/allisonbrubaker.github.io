        <p class="card-desc">This final project for my Session A Media Arts & Design class was a collaborative exploration of how fashion, coding, and digital fabrication can come together to push the boundaries of creative expression. Working with a partner, we designed a custom lace system using a code-based approach grounded in repetition, transformation, and recursion. Our goal was to generate intricate lace-like patterns that could be 3D printed and sewn directly into a dress, blending the delicate aesthetic of traditional lace with the sharp innovation of computational design.</p>

I focused on layering each element intentionally to bring depth, dimension, and a more lifelike quality to otherwise flat vector forms. One of the standout pieces from this series is a custom floral pattern I designed entirely in Illustrator. After experimenting with swatches and redrawing each flower and connecting line digitally, I printed the pattern onto a hoodie to turn the illustration into wearable art. Overall, this project pushed me to refine my digital art techniques while also exploring how my designs could live beyond the screen.</p>

I braided yarn to attach the piece, giving it a cohesive, handmade feel while showcasing the delicate patterns of the fabric. 
Doilies, once symbols of domestic skill and class in the 17th-century Victorian era, are often overlooked today despite their intricate craftsmanship. 
I wanted to give these forgotten objects new life through fashion, moving them from simple decoration into something wearable. 
This experiment inspired me to consider expanding the idea into a full doily set, as I continue exploring the history and artistry behind this craft.</p>

Once finalized, I prepared the file for laser cutting using both cutting and engraving techniques to bring the design to life on a physical material. This project was a hands-on exploration of how code-based design can translate into tactile, functional objects. It reflects the intersection of branding, form, and fabrication, and was a great way to merge aesthetic choices with technical workflow.</p>

I started by sketching and measuring my tea bags, then created a parameterized model in Fusion 360. 
After preparing the file in Illustrator, I laser cut the pieces, which required some troubleshooting and adjustments when a few joints didn’t fit properly. 
With some sanding and refinements, I was able to assemble the organizer and learned a lot about precision and constraints along the way. 
The finished piece now hangs by my microwave and keeps my tea collection neat and accessible, with ideas for future engraving or decoration.</p>

By blending their historical symbolism with contemporary design, I hope to highlight their beauty and bring this craft into a new context.

My process involves creating and designing a pattern, laser cutting it directly into the fabric, and then sewing the altered pieces together. 
This project is inspired by Iris van Herpen’s laser-cut couture line, which combines fashion with digital design and fabrication. 
By applying similar techniques to everyday materials like denim, I am exploring how digital fabrication can transform ordinary garments into unique, statement-making pieces. 
The project is still developing, but it has already pushed me to think about how technology and fashion can intersect in accessible ways.</p>

I focused on layering each element intentionally to bring depth, dimension, and a more lifelike quality to otherwise flat vector forms. The piece began as a blank canvas, and I let shape, color, and careful composition guide the design process. The image in this series took me nearly a full month to complete due to the incredibly detailed process of editing and manually filling in hundreds of small, intricate spaces. I was inspired by a picture I took and used that as inspiration to try to create a national park poster based on the image I took. This project especially taught me the value of patience and how digital tools can be used in a painterly, expressive way.</p>

    <h2>Mount Haleakalā — Illustrator Poster</h2>
    <p>This project features a poster I created in Adobe Illustrator, all built from scratch using the pen tool, custom gradients, and hand-colored swatches. I focused on layering each element intentionally to bring depth, dimension, and a more lifelike quality to otherwise flat vector forms. The piece began as a blank canvas, and I let shape, color, and careful composition guide the design process. The image in this series took me nearly a full month to complete due to the incredibly detailed process of editing and manually filling in hundreds of small, intricate spaces. I was inspired by a picture I took and used that as inspiration to try to create a national park poster based on the image I took. This project especially taught me the value of patience and how digital tools can be used in a painterly, expressive way.</p>
